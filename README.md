### How it works
** Using PagueVeloz is very simple and fast. **

Once you know all the features of PagueVeloz, you will want to use it immediately. You can start celebrating, because that's exactly how it happens. Just register and start using. All without complications and without bureaucracy!

** And the advantages don't end there. **

In the case of payments (boletos and credit cards), as soon as your customer makes the payment and the money appears in the PagueVeloz account, you can already request the redemption of the amount you want. Depending on the time of withdrawal request, the transfer is made on the same day or at most 24 hours later. And if it is to pay bills, the system releases the money at the time you are paying your account.

** Don't waste time and start using it. **
